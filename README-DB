Notes for the database:

The default max. connections for Mariadb is 100.  I upped this to 512.  In order to up it very much, you have to first increase the maximum allowed open files.  This is done by editing /etc/security/limits.conf and adding:

*  soft nofile 65535
*  hard nofile 65535

Then logging out and back in.  The success can be checked by looking at 'ulimit -n' after logging out and in.

Once this is done, edit /etc/my.cnf.d/server.conf and add

max_connections = 512

under [mysqld] and/or [mariadb].

A restart is required for changes to take effect.
