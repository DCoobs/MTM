Installation instructions for Multi-Tenant Munki.

These are more notes than real install instructions.  They hopefully
will become real install instructions at some point.

This package has several pieces.  These need to be placed in several
places on the filesystem.  Also, a new user needs to be created,
'makemunki'.  The web server needs to be able to run a script as
makemunki.  On Debian, the web server runs as www-data, so a line is
needed in the sudoers file granting permission.  To create the user,
do something like this:

# sudo adduser --system makemunki --shell /bin/bash --group

Next, add a line in your sudoers file that looks like this.  Note, you
may need to add '!requiretty' at the end if your sudoers file requires
a valid tty to operate.

# www-data ALL=(makemunki) NOPASSWD:/etc/makemunki/sign_certificate.sh

Now, copy the files from the 'home' folder to makemunki's home
directory:

# cd home && sudo cp -R . ~makemunki
# sudo chown -R makemunki:makemunki ~makemunki
# sudo chmod 1777 ~makemunki/tmp

While we're at it, let's set up the makemunki config in etc:

# sudo mkdir /etc/makemunki
# sudo chown makemunki:makemunki /etc/makemunki

Now, generate the new signing key for the makemunki system, and stub configs:

# sudo /bin/su - makemunki
# ./gen-munki-CAcert.bash /etc/makemunki '/C=Whatever you want/OU=blah'
# cd /etc/makemunki
# cp /path/to/your/MTM/etcmakemunki/* /etc/makemunki

Set up a sitekey for encryption.  Edit /etc/makemunki/sitekey.  Type
32 random characters.  It should start with 32 numbers to guide you.
DON'T LEAVE THIS AS 32 NUMBERS.

Time to edit some config files for MTM.  /etc/makemunki/config is a
text file, Windows(TM) INI format, to configure things.  Edit this
with your favorite text editor.  Most of the values are
self-explanatory, or have a note as to what they mean.  To change the
LDAP password used to look up groups in AD, change to the mtm
directory and run

# php change_ldap_pass.php

You should be prompted for a new password.  This generates and prints an
encrypted string that can be copied to /etc/makemunki/config.  Note
that you want to have the sitekey set first.  Any change to the
sitekey or eth0's MAC address will invalidate this password.

Now it's time to create the database.  To create the database, log in
to mysql as a root user and grant privileges.  Note that this should
be scripted in the future.  This needs to be done as a privileged user
as some views are created that are only creatable by a privileged
user.  After creation, everything can be done with a less privileged
user.

# mysql -uroot
MariaDB [(none)]> grant all on munkicert.* to munkiuser@localhost identified by 'munkipass';
MariaDB [(none)]> create database munkicert;
MariaDB [(none)]> use munkicert;
MariaDB [munkicert]> \. <path to MTM>/munkicert-schema.sql

Time to get the apache configs set up.
