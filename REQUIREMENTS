This is the Multi-Tenant Munki package.  It is being developed on
linux, however it should run on any *nix system capable of running
apache2.4, php, and MySQL (or MariaDB).  The encryption package uses
the MAC address as a salt.  If you don't have linux with eth0, you may
need to edit the file to get entropy from elsewhere.

Requirements:

Apache2.4
  php + pdo + ssl (tested in php5.5)
  mod_dav
  authnz_ldap (For WebDAV authentication)
  authn_db
  authz_db
  mod_rewrite

Shibboleth providing the "member" or "isMemberOf" attribute
  (Somewhat loosely coupled, but still coupled more tightly than
  it probably should be).

AD server (Somewhat loosely coupled, but still....)

Mysql or MariaDB (We develop/test on MariaDB) with innodb support.
